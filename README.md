# Automated-Chess
A mechanical chess where the players give commands via a keypad and the pieces move 
into position automatically. For moving the pieces, we have used a magnet which pulls 
the magnetic pieces from their initial position to the goal position. For horizontal 
and lateral motion of the magnet we have used rack and pinion mechanism. Complete 
development of the project is done with Atmega16 Microcontroller.
The idea was to let the players play chess wirelessly through a server.
Some special moves like Castling, Pawn Promotion, En-passant, etc. were not
included in the code due to the closing deadlines.
